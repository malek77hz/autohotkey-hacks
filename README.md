# autohotkey-hacks

Add useful hotkeys etc
New to autohotkey so im sure these can be improved in a big way

**window_virtual_switch.ahk**
Switch Active window across virtual desktops
* ctrl+alt+win+left (shift left)
* ctrl+alt+win+right (shift right)

works on most windows but there are some where it either does nothing and jumps to next desktop or bounces back... 
i.e. windows mouse & touchpad settings does nothing and also git bash.. the reason for this i think is that they dont support removing the window from the taskbar
